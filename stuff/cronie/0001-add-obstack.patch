+/* Summary:
+
+All the apparent functions defined here are macros. The idea
+is that you would use these pre-tested macros to solve a
+very specific set of problems, and they would run fast.
+Caution: no side-effects in arguments please!! They may be
+evaluated MANY times!!
+
+These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
+small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
+by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
+been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the
+stack" is typically an immature growing object, while the rest of the
+stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.
+
+These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you
+supply, called `obstack_chunk_alloc'.  On occasion, they free chunks,
+by calling `obstack_chunk_free'.  You must define them and declare
+them before using any obstack macros.
+
+Each independent stack is represented by a `struct obstack'.
+Each of the obstack macros expects a pointer to such a structure
+as the first argument.
+
+One motivation for this package is the problem of growing char strings
+in symbol tables.  Unless you are "fascist pig with a read-only mind"
+--Gosper's immortal quote from HAKMEM item 154, out of context--you
+would not like to put any arbitrary upper limit on the length of your
+symbols.
+
+In practice this often means you will build many short symbols and a
+few long symbols.  At the time you are reading a symbol you don't know
+how long it is.  One traditional method is to read a symbol into a
+buffer, realloc()ating the buffer every time you try to read a symbol
+that is longer than the buffer.  This is beaut, but you still will
+want to copy the symbol from the buffer to a more permanent
+symbol-table entry say about half the time.
+
+With obstacks, you can work differently.  Use one obstack for all symbol
+names.  As you read a symbol, grow the name in the obstack gradually.
+When the name is complete, finalize it.  Then, if the symbol exists already,
+free the newly read name.
+
+The way we do this is to take a large chunk, allocating memory from
+low addresses.  When you want to build a symbol in the chunk you just
+add chars above the current "high water mark" in the chunk.  When you
+have finished adding chars, because you got to the end of the symbol,
+you know how long the chars are, and you can create a new object.
+Mostly the chars will not burst over the highest address of the chunk,
+because you would typically expect a chunk to be (say) 100 times as
+long as an average object.
+
+In case that isn't clear, when we have enough chars to make up
+the object, THEY ARE ALREADY CONTIGUOUS IN THE CHUNK (guaranteed)
+so we just point to it where it lies.  No moving of chars is
+needed and this is the second win: potentially long strings need
+never be explicitly shuffled. Once an object is formed, it does not
+change its address during its lifetime.
+
+When the chars burst over a chunk boundary, we allocate a larger
+chunk, and then copy the partly formed object from the end of the old
+chunk to the beginning of the new larger chunk.  We then carry on
+accreting characters to the end of the object as we normally would.
+
+A special macro is provided to add a single char at a time to a
+growing object.  This allows the use of register variables, which
+break the ordinary 'growth' macro.
+
+Summary:
+	We allocate large chunks.
+	We carve out one object at a time from the current chunk.
+	Once carved, an object never moves.
+	We are free to append data of any size to the currently
+	  growing object.
+	Exactly one object is growing in an obstack at any one time.
+	You can run one obstack per control block.
+	You may have as many control blocks as you dare.
+	Because of the way we do it, you can `unwind' an obstack
+	  back to a previous state. (You may remove objects much
+	  as you would with a stack.)
